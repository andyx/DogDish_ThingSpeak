Here is a Tweeting Dog Dish with ThingSpeak
<p>
An Arduino, a Ethernet Shield, Flow Meter, the Ethernet Bridge is just because no wired connection was close. Auto Dog Water Dish was bought online and a few fittings were needed to convert my 1 inch flow meter to and from standard hose connectors.

Pin 2 is used to receive pulses from Flow Meter. Note that the meter is not exactly the same as on AdaFruit, only the pulse factor is different. Adjust ratio in the code as needed. Ground and 5 volts pins are used to power the meter. The picture also shows a very short distance connection. Eventually I replaced that short wire with a longer wire relocating the electronics inside and out of the elements.
<p>
The Ethernet DHCP client connection, combined with Limor's Flow Meter example and the ThingSpeak code makes this a very easy project. Only a few lines is original code. Tweeting is done using a react app within the ThingSpeak site. The project took only a couple hours.

My only problem with the project is that my dogs still prefer to drink from the pool.

Here is a link to the channel chart.
